Type: `class`

Path: `Nickvision::App::ConfigurationBase`

  std::string Key: get
  ```
    - The key of the configuration file.

    - Throws: `std::invalid_argument` if key is empty
- ```cpp
  bool save()
  ```
    - Returns: `true` if the configuration file was saved to disk
    - Returns: `false` if saving to disk failed

### Creating Your Own Configuration Files
The purpose of `ConfigurationBase` is to act as a base when defining your own configuration objects that you would like to be saved and retrieved from disk.

Here are some key points when defining your own configuration objects:
- Your configuration object's constructor must take a `const std::string& key` parameter and pass it to `ConfigurationBase`'s constructor. 
    - Although you will not use key in your own implementation, it is required for `ConfigurationBase`'s functionality and will be filled-in by the `Aura::getConfig()` method.
- `ConfigurationBase` exposes a protected `m_json` object which you must use in your implementation of getting and storing variables of your configuration object. 
    - If this `m_json` object is not used, your configuration object will not be stored to disk correctly.
- You must explicitly call the `save` method on your configuration object when you want to save the configuration to disk. Writing to the `m_json` object is not enough to trigger saving the file on disk

Here is an example of a custom configuration object using `ConfigurationBase`:
```cpp
using namespace Nickvision::App;

class AppConfig : public ConfigurationBase
{
public:
	AppConfig(const std::string& key) 
    : ConfigurationBase{ key } 
	{ 

	}

	int getPreviousCount() const
	{
        //0 is the default value of PreviousCount (i.e. if it does not exist in the file)
		return m_json.get("PreviousCount", 0).asInt();
	}

	void setPreviousCount(int count)
	{
		m_json["PreviousCount"] = count;
	}
};
```
This object can now be used by an Aura-based application:
```cpp
using namespace Nickvision::App;
using namespace Nickvision::Events;

int main()
{
    Aura::getActive().init(...);
    AppConfig& config{ Aura::getActive().getConfig<AppConfig>("config") };
    config.saved() += [](const EventArgs& e) { std::cout << "Config saved to disk." << std::endl; };
    if(config.getPreviousCount() > 0)
    {
        std::cout << config.getPreviousCount() << std::endl;
    }
    config.setPreviousCount(6);
    config.save(); //lambda will be invoked on success
}
```
 
## InterProcessCommunicator
Description: An inter process communicator (server/client).

Interface: [interprocesscommunicator.h](/include/app/interprocesscommunicator.h)

Type: `class`

Path: `Nickvision::App::InterProcessCommunicator`

### Member Variables
- ```
  bool isServer: get
  ```
    - Whether or not this instance is an IPC server.
- ```
  bool isClient: get
  ```
    - Whether or not this instance is an IPC client.

### Events
- ```cpp
  Event<Nickvision::Events::ParamEventArgs<std::vector<std::string>>> CommandReceived
  ```
    - Invoked when this IPC server instance received a command from a client instance.
    - Note: If `isClient()` is true, this event will never be invoked for that instance.

### Methods
- ```cpp
  InterProcessCommunicator(const std::string& id)
  ```
    - Constructs an InterProcessCommunicator.
    - Accepts: The id of the ipc, id. id should be the same value for all instances of ipc that must talk to each other.
    - Note: If this is the first IPC instance for all processes of id, this instance will become an IPC server.
    - Note: If this is not the first IPC instance, this instance will become an IPC client.
    - Throws: `std::runtime_error` if the client or server IPC cannot be created.
- ```cpp
  ~InterProcessCommunicator()
  ```
    - Destructs an InterProcessCommunicator.
- ```cpp
  bool communicate(const std::vector<std::string>& args, bool exitIfClient = false)
  ```
    - Accepts: A command separated by args, args, and a boolean on whether or not to exit the process if this instance is an IPC client, exitIfClient.
    - Returns: `true` if command-line arguments were sent to a server instance.
    - Returns: `false` on failure to send arguments to a server instance
    - Note: If this instance is the running server and communicate was called on said instance, `CommandReceived` will still be triggered with the passed args.

### Performing Inter-Process Communication
libnick uses named-pipes on Windows and Unix Domain Sockets on Linux to establish inter process server and client communicators, while abstracting all of that away from the consumer in the easy to use `InterProcessCommunicator` API.

Upon creating an `InterProcessCommunicator` object, either `isServer()` or `isClient()` will return true depending on whether or not this instance is a server or client respectively. Server instances should register a callback to the `CommandReceived` event to be invoked when clients send commands to the server.

NOTE: Whether or not `InterProcessCommunicator` is a client or server, its object should be kept alive for the entire running of an application to avoid accidentally removing a process as the server instance if the object is destroyed midway of an application running.

Let's consider an example scenario for using the `InterProcessCommunicator`. Assume we have an application where we want the first instance to be considered the main, running instance. Assume that if other instances of said application are started, we want its arguments to be passed to the main instance and then have said other instances be closed. This will allow, for example, a GUI main instance to be manipulated via secondary CLI instances. 

Here's the code for this:
```cpp
using namespace Nickvision::App;

int main(int argc, char*[] argv)
{
    Aura::getActive().init(...);
    std::vector<std::string> modernArgs;
    for(int i = 0; i < argc; i++)
    {
        if(argv[i])
        {
            modernArgs.push_back({ argv[i] });
        }
    }
    InterProcessCommunicator& ipc{ Aura::getActuve().getIPC() };
    ipc.commandReceived() += [](const Events::ParamEventArgs<std::vector<std::string>>& args) { ... };
    ipc.communicate(modernArgs, true);
}
```
If this program is ran for the first time, ipc will be the server instance. `handleArguments` will be invoked after `communicate` with its own arguments, as `communicate` still invokes `CommandReceived` even if ipc is the server instance. 

If this program is ran not for the first time, its arguments will be sent to the first instance and this instance itself will close. The first instance's `handleArguments` function will be called as a result of `CommandReceived` being invoked by the ipc server receiving the command.
